### Roadmap:

[X] Follow the UI of this site: http://www.goodbyewarden.com
[x] Replace CSS by SASS.
[ ] Bug: the quote shared on Twitter will be cut, if there is a semi-colon `;` in the quote. Fix: use regex to remove all `;` of the quote.
[ ] Move buttons to bottom of section 2.
[ ] Move gradient-sticky DIV to the top of screen.
[ ] Remove `overflow: hidden;` of the BODY. Prepair for case if there's long quotes.
